# BPP-Basic-Password-Profiler-
This is a basic password profiler. It requires you to have python installed. It can be used for brute-forcing the login of a person whom you know. I can't guarantee that this will work, because people are safe these days, they don't use stupid patterns for their passwords, BUT some people still do and BPP is made for those kinds of people. You can use the passwords generated by BPP on any brute-force tools like THC Hydra or any brute-force tool, maybe I will bring more changes. Till then, Happy password-profiling.
